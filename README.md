Hello Coders, this is Varun Kumar and this is a Web Development Project in which i made a online Learning Platform named as EduVerts and 
here you will be able to find the content about coding and programming for Computer Science and Information Technology Students.
In this project i made a database where all our data, images, text, and all the other data was saved including Login credencials.
You can see this project live because it has been hosted already and you can use login id as "Student" and Login Password as "Student123", Using this you can experience our project.
The url for the Login page of our E Learning platform is

https://eduverts.000webhostapp.com/login.php

you can use this url to login.
Thank You.
